THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

with him. Ask him whether he wishes to take her
back or not. If so be he says he doeS‚ give her
back ; if 116 doesn't, then Ι have taken the right
course for my daughter.

Granted that the unwillingness is really on his side

and that you, Myrrina, perceived the fault in him,
still Ι was there and I ought to have been consulted
on the prospect. It makes me mad that you have
dared to act in this way without my orders. Ι for-
bid you to remove the child anywhere out of the
house. (turns away) But I am the worse fool of the
two for expecting her to obey my commandS. 1
will go in and charge the servants not to let it be
removed. [Exrr.
I do verily believe I am the most miserable woman
alive. How he’s likely to bear it, if he finds out
the factS, is plain enough, when a much less serious
thing like this has put him in such a passion. And
how to change his view of it I can’t tell. After all
these miseries it’s the crowning disaster if he com-
pels me to recognize a child of whose father we
are in utter ignorance. It was too dark for my
child to tell the man by sight, and nothing of his
was seized that might lead to an identification.
It was he seized on something, for he went off with
the ring from her finger. I am afraid too that
Pamphilus won’t bring himself to keep our appeal
secret any longer when he knows that another man's
child is to be acknowledged as his. [Exrr.
