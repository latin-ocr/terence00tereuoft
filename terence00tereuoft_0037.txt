Well then, as that’s SO, Sir, you ought all the more
to keep awake. Fortune favours the brave.

I can’t command myself.

Come, come now, if ever you've got to command
yourself. If your father sees you're afraid he’ll
think you guilty.

That’s true.

(dolefully) I can't change my nature.

What would you do if your task were still harder?

As I am not equal to this, I should be still less
equal to that.

(to Phaedria) This cock won't fight, Sir3 the game’s
up, no use wasting time here, I'm off. (going)

. So am l.

For heaven's sake, no: suppose I pretend. (en-
deavouring to put on aa air of confidence) Will this

do ?
Absurd.

Keep your eyes on my face. See now, will this do?
No,

(making a better attempt) This then?
That's more like it.
What of this?

That'll do; yes‚ keep that up; and mind you answer
him word for word, hit for hit, else in his rage he'll
rout you with 3 broadside of curseS.

(dolefully) Ι knOW.

Say you were forced into it against your will.

. By the statute, by the court.

Do you see, eh? Hollo, who’s that old gentleman
at the end of the street? It’s himself.
