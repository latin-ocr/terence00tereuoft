ΤΗΕ MOTHER-IN-LAW

Pam. (mide) He knows of the birth! Damnation

Laches Child? What child?

Phi. We have a grandson born. My daughter was with
child when she was removed from your house,
though till this very day Ι never knew it.

Laches Good neWS, as Ι hope to be saved! I rejoice that
it's born and that your daughter does well. But
what sort of lady is your wife? Rather a strange·
disposition, eh ? It' s odd we should have been kept i u
the dark all this time. I can hardly express my
sense of the impropriety.

Phi. Ι am every bit as much displeased with her conduct
as you are, my good friend.

Pam. (aside) Even if I had any hesitation before I have
none now, since she brings with her another man's
child.

Laches You have no longer any room for choice, Pamphilus.

Pam. (aside) Confound it all!

Laches This is a day we often prayed to see, when you
should have a child of your own to call you father.
It’s come, and I thank heaven for it.

Pam. (aside) There's an end of nie!

Laches 'l'ake back your wife and don't set yourself against
me.

Pam. Father, if she had desired to have a child by me or
to remain as my wife, Ι am perfectl y sure she would
never have concealed from me what I perceive she
has kept dark. Now, feeling as I do that her heart
is estranged from me-—what's more, I don’t think
we shall ever agree—why should I take her back?

Laches She was quite under her mother’s thumb3 she's very
young, remember3 anything strange in that? You
don't think you can find any woman quite free from

blame, do you? or any men that don't sin at times?
