THE BROTHERs

That's the spirit of a true father, to accustom his
son to do right rather by his own inclination than
by sear of another, and that’s the difference be-
tween the parent of sons and the owner of slaves,
A man who can't do this should own that he doesn't
know how to rule a gentleman’s sons. Ah, is that the
man I was talking of? It is. He looks a bit glum.
I suppose we shall now have the usual scolding.
ENTER Demea As rnoM THE coUN'rRY.

Glad to see you well, Demea.

Demea (blwztly) Ah, well met! you're the man l’m hunting
up.

Micio Why are you so glum?

Demea A pretty question! Asking why I'm glum when we
have an Aeschinus 011 our hands!

Micio (aside) Didn't 1 say so? (ahud) What's he done?

Demea Done? Ashamed of nothing, afraid of nobody‚
holding himself above the check of law 1 Of his old
doings I say nothing: what is his last outrage?

Micio What is it?

Demea Broken a door-lock‚ forced his way into a strange
house, beaten the owner and all the household
almost to death, carried off the girl 116 loved. All
the town is crying out at it as a most scandalous
business. Man after man has told me of it in the
streets, it's on everybody’s lips. Bad enough that,
and, if he wants a pattern set him. doesn’t he see
how his brother attends to business and leads a
,thrifty and sober life in the country on quite other
lines ? My reproaches to lzim are reproaches to you,
Micio ε it’s you that let him grow debauched.

Μῖσιο (ealmly) There is nothing more unjust than a man
without knowledge of the world :he thinks nothing

right except what he has done himself. 225
