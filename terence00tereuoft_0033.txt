PHORMIO

true gentlewoman and have married her, as you
wished, honourably in the light of day, happy
indeed but for the one laek of 3 temper to bear
your fortune contentedly. But if you had to do
with that slave-dealer that I have, then you’d know
what it is. It's the way with pretty nearly all of
uS‚ every man is sorry for himself.

On the contrary it's you I take for the happy man,
Phaedria3 you are still unhampered in thinking
what you may do, keep or drop your love. I am
fallen into the unhappy case of not being able to
do either. (turns round) H0110‚what's this? Is that
Geta coming up at 3 run? It is. Hang it, I’m
afraid he has bad news, (they stand aside)

ENTER Geta HURROEDLY.
(not seez‘ng the others and pacing up and down) You’re
done for, Geta, unless you find some plan at once:
you weren't ready for all this cloud of trouble. l
don’t know how to avoid the storm or how to survive
its bursting. Hidden any longer our piece of
daring can’t be.
(aside to Phaedria) What's his excitement?

What's worse, I've only 3 moment to think. Master's
come.

(as before) What’s the trouble?

When he hears of it how can I soothe his rage?
Tell him? That's fuel to him. Not tell him?
That's goading him to worse. Defend myself ?
Labour lost! Curse it all, it’s not my own skin
only; I'm tortured no less for Antipho: it's kim I
pity, lu‘m I sear for, it’s ke keeps me here: else 1
