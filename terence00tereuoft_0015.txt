SUMMARY OF THE PLAY

ΒΥ GAIUS SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS

Demipho, brother to ChremeS, was abroad, having
left his son Antipho at Athens. Chremes had
secret] y contracted a bigamous marriage at Lemnos
and had a daughter there. His original wife was
at Athens with a son devoted to a lady fiddler.
The Lemnian wife came to Athens and died there.
Chremes was away at the time and there was only
her daughter to bury her. Antipho saw the daughter
at the funeral, fell in love with her, and by the aid
of an adventurer married her. His father and
Chremes on their return were highly indignant.
They gave the adventurer a hundred and twenty
pounds to marry the girl in Antipho's place. The
money was used to buy the fiddle—girl. Chremes
however recognized his daughter and Antipho
retained his wife.
