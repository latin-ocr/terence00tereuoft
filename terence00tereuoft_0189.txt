THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

eouldn't bear to see your daughter married to a
man with a mistreSS‚ a man who stayed out at
night.

(aa-ide) Better he suspect any cause than the right one.

That was a fact which Ι knew long before you did,
Myrrina3 but Ι didn’t regard it as a grievous
offence‚ it’s a thing young men do. I tell you the
time will soon come when he will hate to think of
it. But the spirit you showed to start with you
have shown unceasingly ever since: you have set
yourself to get your daughter away from him and
upset the arrangement which Ι, yes Ι, had made.
What has happened now lets out what your object
was.

Do you think a mother would be so wrong-headed
as to show that spirit towards her own child, if she
thought the marriage were good for us?

Has this mother the wits to foresee or judge what
is for our benefit? Perhaps you heard somebody
say he had seen him coming out of the woman’s
house or going in. What if he did? If his visits
were disereet and occasional, wasn't it more reason-
able for us to wink at it than set ourselves to know
all about it only to make him hate us ? If he could
have torn himself away all in a moment fromawoman
he had known years and yearS‚ Ι shouldn’t have
thought him human, nor a man of constancy enough

to marry my daughter.
No more of the young man, pray, or of what you
call mv offence. Go and have a private interview
