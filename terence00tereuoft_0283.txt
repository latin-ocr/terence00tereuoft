THE BROTHERS

Bah, how Ι could have wished it were‘ the custom
to attend to one’s friends' business by night as
well! Never mind, be you easy: I've got the hang

of his disposition finely. When he's at his hottest
Ι make him as gentle as a ewe.

How?

He’s delighted to hear you praised. I make you
out to him to be an angel. Virtues are my theme.
(astonished) Mine?

Yours. The tears start at once down his old

cheeks like a boy’s for delight. (points up the street)
There's for you now Ῑ

What is it?
The wolf in the story.
Is it my father?
Your father it is,
(alarmed) Syru5,' what are we to do?
Run away indoors, I’ll see to it.
If he askS, you haven't seen me anywhere, do you
hear ?

Can't you shut up Ρ (pm-hes Izim off)

ENTER Demea.
(not seez'ng Syrus) On my word I’m an unfortunate
creature! I can't find my brother anywhere in the
world. More, while Ι was looking for him, I caught
sight of one of my farm servants: he says my son
is not in the country, and Ι don’t know what to do.
(patting his head out at the door and whispering) S ⁸vrus '
(mhisperz’ng) What’s the matter?
Is it me. he's looking for?
Yes.
Confound it l
Just you keep your heart up. (Ctesipho disappears)

Demea (as before) What the plague does this ill luck
