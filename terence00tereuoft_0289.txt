THE BROTHERS

down it you go. At the end there’s'a chapel 011
this side. Just by the side of it there’s an alley.

Demea Which?

Syrus That where the great wild-fig-tree is.
Demea I know it.

Syrus Take that way.

³ Demea (reflecting) That’s a blind alley.

’ Syrus So itis, by Jove. Tut, tut, you must think me a
fool. I made a mistake. Come back to the
colonnade : yeS, yeS, that's a much nearer way and
much less chance of missing it. Do you know
Cratinus’s house, the millionaire man there?

Demea Yes.

Syrus When you are past it 'curn to your left, go straight
along the street and when you come to the Chmch
turn to the right. Before you come to the town-
gate, close by the pool there's a baker’s shop and

⁴ opposite it a workshop. That's where he is,

Demea What's he doing there?

Syrus Giving an order for some gai-den seats with
holmoak legs.

Demea (3·nee1·iwg as ai eoetravagance) For one of your
drinking-partieS, quite 30, quite 30. Ι’(1 better go
to him at once. [Exrr.

Syrus (loolcing afler him) Yes, go your way. I'll give you
the exercise you deserve, Ι swear I will, (with a loml
caelele) old Drybones! (turning round ancl gyamm'ng)
Aeschinus is cursedly late, this dinner‘s spoiling,
Ctesipho is drowned in love. Now I'll look out
for myself, for I'll go off ai: once and pick out
every blessed titbit and with one glass after

another I'll lazily lengthen out the day.
