PHORMIO

You Ι knew were as loyal to me as I am to myself.
If an outsider desires the connexion, he will hold
his tongue so long as we are on good termS, but if
116 1133 3 tiff with me he’ll know more than he ought
to know. And Ι have my fears that some way or
other my wife may get to know of it. If she doeS‚
there’s nothing left for me but to turn myself out
and never darken my own door again, for Ι’111 1116
only thing in my house that I can call my own.
I know that's so and your trouble is mine, and 1
shall never weary till Ι have carried out what I
promised you.

(coming domn the street and not seez‘ng tlze old men)
A sharper fellow than Phormio I’ve never set eyes
on. Ι come to my man to tell him we wanted
money and how we came to want it. Ι was barely
half through with my story when he’d see it all.
He was delighted, commended me, asked to see
the old man. He thanked heaven he had a chance
of showing he was just as much a friend of Phaedria’s
as of Antipho's. Ι told him to wait for me in the
Piazza and I'd bring the old man there. (sees
Demipho) Ah, there he is. Who's that behind
him? Crimini! Phaedria’s father’s come back.
(recoverz’ng himself) Bah! why was I such a dolt as
to be scared? Because I’ve got a couple to take
in instead of one? I think it’s all to the good to
have two strings to one's bow. I'll apply to the
man Ι was first after: if he provides the money,
then Ι have it: if Ι fail with him, then have at the
newcomer.

ENTER Antipho FRoM ms FATHER'S nousm.
