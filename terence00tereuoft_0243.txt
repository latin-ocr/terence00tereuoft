THE BROTHERS

saying you are sorry, Ι shan’t car‘e that sor it,
(snaps his fingers) You may take it from me that
I shall go to law for my rights, and it’s not words
will pay for your maltreatment of me. I know
your ways: “Sor1·y,'' you'll say, “sorry3 I'll take an
oath you’re a man it was a shame to wrong like
that‚’' and that when I have been treated in the
most shameful way.

Aes. (to Par-meno) Go on, be brisk, open the door.

Sannio What? No regard for what I say? (Parmeno opens
the door of Micio’s house)

Α es. (to the girl) In with you straight.

Sannio (getting between her and the door) I tell you I won’t
have it.

Aes, Stand near him, Parmeno: you've got too much this
way. Here, stand here close to the fellow, (Par-
meno does so) YeS‚ that’s right. Now take care you
never take your eyes off mine, so that, if Ι nod to
you, you may be quiek and plant your fist on his
jaw that very instant.

Sannio I should just like to see him try. (the girl goes
towards the door and Sannio clutelzes her) ³

Aes. There, look out3 let go the girl. (nods to Parmeno
who gives Sannio a violent blow)

Sannio Shameful, shameful!

Aes. He'll give you another if you don’t look out. (Par-
meno repeats the blo-m)

Sannio Oh, oh!
Aes. I hadn’t nodded but it’s better to err on that side,

it’s true. (to tlze girl) Now in with you.
[EXEUNT THE mm. AND Parmeno 1N'ro 'rim nousn.
Sannio What’s all this? Are you a monarch here, Aes-

chinus ?
