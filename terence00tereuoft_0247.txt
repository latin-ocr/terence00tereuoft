THE BROTHERS

You gave a hundred pounds for her (curse on your
purchase 1) You shall have the sum.

What? If Ι refuse to sell, will you force me?

⁷N ot at all.

Oh, 1 was afraid you would.

And Ι don’t think she ought to be sold, being a
free woman. Yes‚ Ι enter a plea that free she is.
Now then consider your choice, getting the money
or getting up your case. Think it over till I come

back, (sneerz'ng) master slave-dealer.
[Exrr 1N'ro ms Housr:

God in heaven! I don't wonder that outrage drives
men into Bedlam. He tore me out of my house,
cudgelled me, carried off my girl in spite of my
teeth, showered a thousand blows or more on an
unhappy creature, and in requital for these enor-
mities he demands to have the girl at cost price.
(ironically) However in return for all his noble ser—
vices to me, so be it: he has a right to be gratified.
Come now, come, I am eager for it, if only he would
pay me. But I talk like a fool. As soon as I agree
to the price he will have witnesses to prove that l
have sold her and the money will be moonshine.
“I'll pay ·you before long, come again to-morrow.’'
Even that I could put up with, provided he does

pay, outrage though it is. But Ι face facts: when
you set up in my line, you must receive and pocket
outrages from young men. Still here nobody will
pay me, so these private calculations are all beside

the mark.
