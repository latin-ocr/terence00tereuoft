THE BROTHERS

Demea (gruffly) And the point of that observation?

Micio

Is that you, Demea, misjudge these matters
There is no heinous crime, believe me, in a stripling’s
having an amour or attending a drinking party.
(Demea makes α gesture of dissent) No, there isn't,
nor in his breaking a door-look. If neither you nor
I did these thingS, it was our poverty wouldn't let
us. Do you now take eredit for an abstinenee
which at the time was due only to lack of
means? It’s not just, for if we had had the
wherewithal we should have done the same.
And if you were flesh and blood you’d allow
that son of yours to do it now, while his youth
makes it reasonable, rather than have him look
forward to tumbling your eorpse out of doors and
then at a less fitting time of life run riot for all
your care.

Demea (furiously) Good God! you’re a man to drive one

to Bedlam! Not a heinous crime for these things
to be done by a stripling?

(stoppz'ng his ears) Oh! listen to me instead oi
stunning me by your perpetual repetitions. You
gave me your son to adopt3 he is become mine : ii
he commits an offence, Demea, it's an offence
against me, the chief share in the matter is mine.
His dinner partieS, drinking partieS, reeking of
persumes, are at my eost. He has an amour, l
shall give him the money so long as it’s convenient3
when it isn't, possibly his mistress will shut her
door against him. He has broken a door-look, I’ll
send a locksmith: he has torn a man's coat, I'll
send a 'tailon The means for this, thank God‚
the meansI'- have, and up to now it isn’t irksome.

To end all, either have done or else name an
