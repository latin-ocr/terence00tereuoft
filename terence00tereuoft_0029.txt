please, since you won't be for eontesting any one
of them, Ι shall of course establish. Your father
will come back, I am in for a row, but what care
I? The girl will be ourS.

A sporting venture'

Our man agreed, it was done, we come into court,
we are beaten, he has married her.

You don't say so?

But I do say so,

O Geta, what will become of you?

Lord! I don’t know. One thing I know (qffoeting
herois-m), come what will I shall bear it philo-

sophically.

Good! There's a man for you!

My dependenee is wholly on myself.
Bravo!

Likely that I should go to an intercessor to plead
for me in this style: “ For this time please let him
off, but if he ever offend again, no intercession
from me,’' all but adding, ζ when I am gone, if
you like hang him straight off.’'

What of the gentleman usher, the cithern-girl’s
escort, you know? How does he get on?

So SO, rather poorly.

Hasn’t much to give perhaps?

Nothing but hope, bare hope.

His father back yet or not?

Not yet.

And your old man, when do you look for lzzm?

Can't say for certain. I heard just now there was
a letter come from him and taken into the harbour
office. I'll go and get it.
