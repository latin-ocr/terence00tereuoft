THE BROTHERS

The elder of them I have adopted. I have brought
him up from his childhood, regarded him and loved
him as my own son. In that is the joy of my life,
the one thing Ι hold dear. Ι am zealous that he
should show the same spirit towards me. I give
him money, overlook his peccadilloeS, don’t feel
compelled to exercise full authority over him In
fact, whereas other sons hide their youthful pranks
from their fathers, I have trained my son not to
keep his a secret from me; for if a lad has got
accustomed or brings himself to meet his father with
falsehoods or tricks, all the more will he so meet
others.

In my view honour and gentlemanly feeiing
are better curbs on a gentleman’s son than fear.
My brother and I disagree in this, he is quite a-
gainst this view, He comes to me perpetually,
crying What are you about, Micio? Why are you
bringing the boy to ruin on our hands? Why this
licence? Why these drinking parties? Why do you

pile him up the guineas for such a life and let him ’

spend so much at the tailor’s? It’s extremely silly
of you.'’ He himself is extremely hard, past right
and sense, and in my opinion it’s a great mistake
to suppose that the authority which is founded on
force has more weight and stability than that which
hangs by the link of friendliness. My system, my
theory, is this: he who does his duty under the lash
of punishment has no dread except in the thought
of detection; if he thinks he won't be found out,
back he goes to his natural bent. When you link
a son to you by kindness, there is sincerity in all
his actS‚ he sets himself to make a return, and
will be the same behind your back as to your face.
