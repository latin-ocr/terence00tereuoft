THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

machm- What is it prevents your bringing it about? What,
you don’t mean to say she has anything against her
husband?

Iphi. No, n0, no, When I pressed it and set about
coercing her into a return, she most solemnly
averred that she couldn't endure staying in your
house while Pamphilus was away. Different men
perhaps have different faults: Ι am of a mild dis-
position and cannot bring myself to thwart my
family.

ILaches (aside to his mse) You see, Sostrata.

⁵30. (nearly weepz'ng) Oh dear, oh dear!

ILaches (to Phidippus) Is that irrevocable?

thi. For the time apparently. Is there anything more
I can do for you? Some business calls me down to
the Piazza.

Laches. I will go with you. [EXIT wrm Phidippus.

³80. (soliloquizes) Oh heavens, how unfair it is that we
should be all alike hated by our husbands on account
of a few wives whose doings make us all be thought
to deserve ill treatment! So help me heaven, about
my husband’s present accusation I am blameleSS.
But it's not so easy to clear myself : they have made
themselves believe that all mothers-in-law are harsh.
I'm sure I am not. I have always treated her as
my own daughter, and I can‘t think why this should
befall me. Oh, how eagerly I do look for my boy
to come home. [ExlT INTo ΗΕΒ ΗουεΕ.
