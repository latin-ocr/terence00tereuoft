THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

EN'rl-:R Sostrata ΛΝΒ Pamphilus.
It has not escaped me, my son, that you have 3
suspicion against me that it was my ways caused
your wife’s departure, careful though you are not
to show it. But, as I hope to prosper and be blessed
in you according to my earnest prayers, I have
never knowingly done anything to justify her in
taking a dislike to me. Ι always thought you loved
me and to-day you have confirmed my belief. Your
father has just told me indoors how you set me
before your love. Now I am resolved to make you
a return so that you may know that in my heart a
son’s affection has its reward. My dear Pamphilus,
what I consider the best course for you and your
wife and for my good name is this: I am firmly
resolved to go off into the country with your father
that my presence may be no bar, and no reason may
be left why your Philumena should not return to
yon.
Mother mine, what thoughts are these? You to
give way to her foolishness and leave town to settle
in the country ? It shall not be, nor will Ι allow any
backbiting enemy to say that the cause was my
obstinacy, not your good-nature. Ι couldn’t think
of your giving up for my sake your friends and re-
lations and all your diversions.
I have no longer any delight in what you talk of.
When I was young enough, I had my full share in
them: now I have had enough of such interests.
What I care most for now is that no one should
feel my length of days to be a bar to him or look
forward for my death. Here Ι 3111, as I see, dis-
liked‚ though 1 don’t deserve it: it is time I retired.
That is the best way, I think, to cut off all reasons
