THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

Laches (aside) God avert misfortune!

So,

And some day you'll find out that you have accused
me without a reason, Ι know that.

Laches Without a reason? You? Can words be found hard

Laches

enough for what you’ve done? Disgracing me and
yourself and the family, and building up sorrow for
your son! And then turning friends into 6116111163,
33 you do his wife’s kindred, and that when they had
thought him a fit man to trust their child to! You
alone come on the scene to make the marriage a
failure by your shameless doingS.

You Ι say, woman, who take me for a stone instead
of flesh and blood. Do you women think that,
because I am mostly in the country, I don't know
how every one of you passes her days here? 1
know much better what goes on herc than what
goes on there, though I am there continually.
Weeks ago I was told that Philumena had taken a
dislike to you, and not the least wonder3 it would
have been more wonderful if she hadn't. But what
I didn’t suppose was that she went the length of
disliking all our family. If I had known it, choice
for choice she should have stopped here and out yon
should have gone. (clangz'ng lzis tone) Woman,
woman, think how little cause I’ve given you to
bring this distress on me. l went off to live in

· the country, falling in with your likings and doing

the economical thing, so that our income might
stand the expenses and the idle ways of you and
the boy, and I didn’t stint labour that went beyond
reason and my years. The least return you could

make was to save me all vexations.
