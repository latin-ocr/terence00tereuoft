THE MOTHER—lN-LAW

employ such cantion as may avoid a rash act. lf
you act or mean to act as good women should, to
offer you any blundering insult when you don’t
deservo it would be unjust.

bacchis I do assure you that for that I am sincerely grateful
to you3 an apology after an insult would not hc
much use to me. What is it that you wish ?

Laches You receive visits from my son Pamphilus.

Bacchis Ah—-

Laches (interrupting) Please let me speak. Before he
married Ι put up with this. (Bacchis is about lo
interrupi) One moment3 Ι haven’t yet told you
what I wanted with you⁸ He is now married.
Look out for some friend who will stick closer to
you before it is too late. He won't be of the same
mind all his life, and you won't always be as young
as you are.

Bacchis WVhose story is that?

Laches His mother-in-law'S.

Bacchis About me?

Laches No other, and she has carried off her daughter and
she wished on this account privately to make away
with the child that is born.

Bacchis If I knew any other means of strengthening your
belief in my word, anything more sacred than an
oath, I would promise to take it to assure you that
ever since Pamphilus married I have kept him at
a distance.

Laches You are a good girl, but do you know what I'd
still sooner have you do if you don't mind?

Bacchis What? Tell me.

Laches Go and visit the women here and promise them as
well to take this oath. Satisfy their minds and

clear yourself of the accusation.
