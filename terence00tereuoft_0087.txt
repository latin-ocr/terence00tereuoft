PHORMIO

It's for my sake she's turned out3 it’s right 1
should lose the money.

“Let me know as soon as possible,” says he, “so
that, if they give me the girl, I may break with the
other and not be on the fence, for the other parties
have arranged to pay me the dowry at once.’'

(to Demipho) Let him have it at once, let him send

and break with them, and marry this one.

And the devil go with him!

Very luckily I've got this money with me nOW, the
rents of my wife’s tarms at Lemnos. I'll take it
out of that sum and tell my wife you had a call for
it. [EXEUNT Chremes ΛΝΒ Demipho 1N'ro Chremes’

(comes forward in anger) Geta

(clzeerfully) Well, Sir.

What have you been at?

I've diddled the old men out of the cash, (gleeficlly)
Is that good enough?

Enough? Hanged if I know: it’s the sum I was
told to get.

What, you knave? Do you pretend to mistake my
question? (leiclcs him)

(sullcily) Well, what do you mean then?

By your doing I’m brought to the halter, plain as
day. May all the powers above and below damn
you to the worst of punishments! Look there, if
you want a thing done commission him with it, to
steer you from still water on to a rock. Could
anything be worse than touching on that sore or
mentioning my wife? You've inoculated my father
with the hope of thrusting her out. Tell me this
now about the future: if Phormio gets the dowry,
he must marry the wife: what then?
