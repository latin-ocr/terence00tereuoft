Nothing, I suppose, you want my help for?
Nothing. No, goxyou off home and comfort your

ACT IV

(Half an hom· has elapsed.)

ENTER Chremes IN TRAVELLING DREss ΛΝΒ Demipho.

⁰. By the way, about the object which took you to

Lemnos, ’ Chremes? Your daughter, have you
brought her with you?

No.

Why not?

As her mother found Ι was staying here longer
than usual and the girl was getting too old to wait
for my inattention, she had set out, they told
me, with all her household to join me.

⁸. Well then, why did you stop there so long after

you were told that?
Lord! I was detained by illness.

· ”. Where did you catch it? What was it?

No matter: old age is an illness in itself. However
that they arrived safe I learnt from the captain of
the ship that brought them.

'. You have heard of the trouble that befell my son

while I was away, eh?
Yes, and it’s that which causes an uncertainty in
my plans, because, if I make a match for my girl

³ with anyone outside the family, I shall have to

explain precisely how she comes to be my daughter.
