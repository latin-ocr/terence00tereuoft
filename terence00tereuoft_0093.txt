 

PHORMIO

And it was penury drove me into it, though I knew
this marriage wouldn't hold. Ι wanted time to
turn round and had to provide her with a livelihood
till I could.

(aside) By heaven, unless my memory is out or my
eyesight fails, this is my daughter's nurse.

And we get no traces-

(aside, much agitated) What shall Ι do?

—of her father.

(aside) Am I to go up to her or stop here till I catch
clearer what she's saying?

If only Ι could find him now I have nothing to fear.
(aside) It is the nurse. I’ll speak to her. (goes formard)
(ker baclc to him) VVho's that talking?

Sophrona!

My name too!

Turn and look at me.

(turns round) For mercy's sake, are you Stilpho?
No.

You deny it? (they are now near Chremes’ door)
Come away a little from the doorway, this way,
please‚ Sophrona. (they move away: he mhispers)
Never you call me that name again!

What? Aren't you the man you always said you
were?

Hush!

Why are you afraid of that door?
Behind it I have a wife, a vixen. Why I told you ⁸
falsely, when I did, that that was my name was that
some of you might happen to let my real name leak
out unawares and in consequence my wife might
somehow find it all out.

Well I declare! That’s why we poor creatures never
could find you here.
