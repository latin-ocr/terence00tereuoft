PHORMIO

1 will follow my rule of first paying first served.
Good day to you. [ΕΧΙΤ wrm AN Am OF 1NsoLmNcu.
(turning doleficlly to Antipho) What am 1 to do?
Where can a poor devil like me raise the money at
such short notice, when Ι have less than nothing?
If I could have wrung the three days out of him,
I had a promise of it. (ahnost in tears)

Geta, Geta, we can't let him be brought to this
misery after his giving me just now the hearty
assistance you spoke of. We really must try now
that he needs it to repay his kindness.

(slomly and doubtfully) YeS, I know of course that is
fair.

Come then, no one but you can save him.

What am I to do!

You must raise the money.

I’m keen on it, but where? Please tell me that.
My father is back Ln town.

I know that, but what follows?

Tut, tut, a word's enough for the wise.

That's what you say, is it?

I do.

And by Jove, Sir, mighty pretty advice! Get along
with you! Isn't it triumph enough for me to have
escaped punishment for your wedding without your
telling me to jump for your cousin's sake from the
frying-pan into the fire?

(turning to Phaedria) There's reason in what he
says, ·

scae. But, Geta, ain't I one of the family?

I don't deny it, but surely, surely it's enough that
the old man is angry with us all without our goad-
ing him to the point where we might cry for mercy
m vam.
