'THE MoTHEss-m-LAW

Settle it between you, Laches, and yo‘u, Pamphilus,
whether you require her to be left with us or taken
back. You will find on my side no obstacle to
either course. What my wife does, that I can’t
help. But what shall we do with the child>

An absurd question! Whatever’s done, you must oi
course surrender the child to its father for us to
bring up our own.

(forgetting himseff) When its own father has slighted
it, am I to bring it up?

(hearing only the last words) What do you say?
What, boy? Are we not to bring it up? Pray‚
shall we abandon it? What madness is all this?
Upon my word I can hold my tongue no longer;
you compel me to say what I am unwilling to say
in your father-in-law's presence. Do you think I'm
not the man to know what your tears mean? or why
you are upset in this fashion? When you first
alleged it was for your mother’s sake you couldn’t
keep your wife at home, she promised to leave the
house. Now, when you see yourself deprived of
this pretext even, the child’s birth being kept secret
has enabled you to hit on another. You are in
error if you imagine me ignorant of what's in your
mind. In order that you might some day devote
yourself to your wife, what a time I allowed you to
keep up your amour! The money you spent on it,
how patiently Ι bore it¹ Ι urged and entreated you
to marry, I said it was time you did: at my in-
stigation you married. In complying with my wishes
then you did as became you, now your heart is gone
back to your mistreSS‚ and your compliance with
her is a grievous insult to your wife. Ves, I see

that you’ve slid back again into your former Ιίίὶῗέ)1
