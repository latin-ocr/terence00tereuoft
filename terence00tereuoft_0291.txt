THE B ROTHERS

EN'I'ER Micio AND Hegio:
Really, HegiO, Ι 366 110 reason in this matter why
you should belaud me so much. I am only doing
my duty. The offence was ours and Ι make amends
You can hardly have reckoned me with the class of
men who take the view that it is an unprovoked
wrong if you protest against a wrong done by them·
selves and themselves positively attack you, Is it
oecause Ι have not acted thus that you thank me ?
Not at all, not at all. Ι have never imagined your
disposition to be other than it 13. Now be so good
as to come with me and see the girl's mother,
Micio, and say in person to the lady just what you
have said to me, that what 1133 caused her suspicion
was done for his brother's sake, that the cithern-girl
is Ctesipho's.
If you think it the right course or if it is necessary,
let us g0.
That is right. Not only will it be a relies to her
mind, wasting away as she 13, under pain and
affliction, but you will have done your duty. If
you don't take this view, Ι will myself repeat to her
what you have said.

Oh n0, I will go,

Hegio That is right. &Vlien people are not so prosperous

Micio

as they might be, they are always somehow
more inclined to take offence, to imagine that a
slight is intended. Their want of means always
makes them think that you are toying with them.
Hence an apology made in person is the better wa)
to sooth them.

A just and true observation.

Hegio Then come with me indoorS.

Micio

By all means, [Exsuwr ιΝΤο Sostrata’s.
