THE MOTHER-lN-LAW

Par. That is 80, I tell you.

Pam. Who more fortunate than Ι or more blessed in love?
Man, man, what am I to give you in reward for
your news? what? what? Ι can’t tell.

Par. But Ι 0311.

Pam. What?

Par. Why nothing, for I don’t know what good there is
for you in the news or in me either.

Pam. What?¹ When I was dead and buried and you

· brought me back into the light of day, could Ι 161
you go off without a reward? Man, you must think
me very ungrateful. Ah, there's Bacchis standing
at our door: she’s waiting for me, I fancy: now to
her.

Bacchis Good day, Pamphilus.

Pam. O Bacchis, oh my dear Bacchis, my preserver.

Bacchis All’s well and I'm delighted at it.

Pam. Your acts make me believe your words. YeS, and
you keep your old charm. To meet yon, to hear
you, to see you come, is a delight always and
everywhere.

Bacchis (laughing) Yes, and on my word you keep your old
way and character of being absolutely the most
winsome man in the wide world.

Pam. Ha, ha, ha! That from you to me?

Bacchis You were quite right to love your wife, Pamphilus.
I couldn't Say so before, for till to-day I had never
seen her to know her. Quite the lady, Ι see.

Pam. Honestly?

Bacchis Yes. Pamphilus, as I hope to be saved.
