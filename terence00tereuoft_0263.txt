THE BROTHERS

ἶ Geta Aeschinus-
80. What of Aeschinus?
Geta —has cut himself off from our family.

So. ἔζη {Hpeaven save us ! (buries herface in ker hands)
Geta Hezsul'allen in love with some one else.
So. Heaven help me ἔ

Geta And makes no secret of it, carried her off himself
from a slave-dealer's with no concealment.

So. Are you quite sure of it?
Geta Quite. I saw it myself, Ma’am,

So, (crying bitterly) Unhappy woman that I am ἔ What
istenetogbqelieve any longer ? Whom can one trust ?
What, our Aese‘hiImS, the life of all of us, on whom
all our hopes and chauces lay ? He who swore that
without my daughter he wouldn’t live a single day ?
He who said he would put his baby in his father's
arms and thus implore his leave to marry her?

Geta Stop weeping, Ma'am3 rather look to the future
and see what we must do. Are we to sit down
under it or tell the facts to some one?

Can. Gracious goodness, man alive, are you in your
senses? Do you think it ought to be disclosed
anywhere?

Geta No, I don't for one. In the first place the facts
show that he is estranged from us ε now, if we dis-
close the thing, he’ll deny it, I'm sure of that3
consequently your good name, Ma'am, and your
daughter's life will fall into hazard. What's more,
even if he owned up to the full, as he’s in love with
some one else, it would be a bad thing for her to be
married to him. So, take it as you will, we must
hold our tongues.
