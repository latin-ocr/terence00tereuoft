Demea Then moreover-

Syrus (interrupting) Lord, Sir, Ι haven't time to listen at
the moment. I have hit on a good bargain in fish
and must see they're not spoiled in the cooking.
YeS, it’s just as much a sin in us servants not to do
this as it is in you masterS, Sir, not to do what you
said just nOW, and as far as I can I school my fellow
servants after that same pattern of yours. (imitating
Demea) “That’s too salt,'’ I say, “that’s roasted to
a cinder, that’s not properly cleaned3 that one's
right, remember to do like that again.'' I'm a
zealous teacher up to my lights. Lastly I tell 'em
to look into the dishes as into a looking-glass‚ Sir,
and I teach 'em what ought to be done. Silly
enough these doings of ours I’m aware, but what
can one do? As a man’s made, so you should humour
him. Anything more I can do for you, Sir?

Demea (gruffly) Get yourself supplied with a better mind.

Demea Off to the country? l should think SO‚ as the boy
I came about is off there already. He is my sole care,

down the street? Is it my connexion Hegio? If
my eyes speak truth, Hegio it certainly is. Ah,
a man who has been a friend of ours from a boy.
Bless us all, we have a sore lack of men of that
stamp, men of the old worth and honour. It would
be long before any harm to the country grew out

of kim. What a pleasure to see him! When 1 1355}
