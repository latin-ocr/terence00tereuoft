So help me, it looks as though the devil were in it.
(aside) Grit in their shoes'

What! He to get all this money out of us and
laugh at us so openly? God! I'd rather die on the
spot. Now then, courage forward‚ wits about you'
You see your peccadillo is come out and you can no
longer hide it from your wife: now, as she is sure
to hear it from some one else, the better way to
appease her is to inform her ourselves. Then we

shall be able to punish this beast of a man in our
own way.

(to himself) Hollo, hollo, if I don’t look out Ι’111 in

the mud. They're for a desperadoes’ march against
me.

But I am afraid it will be impossible to appease her.
Courage, man. I will make you friends on the
strength of the girl’s mother being deceased.
(overhearing and coming formard) That's the way you
deal with 1116, is it? A very cunning plan of attack!
I warn you, Demipho, that your way of driving me
hasn't been for your brother’s good. (to Chremes)
What do you mean? You followed your fancy in
another land, no respect for your excellent wife
stopped you from wronging her after a novel pattern,
and are you now to come with prayers on your lips
to cleanse your offence? I’ll say things to her that
will set her in such a blaze that you couldn't put
it out by turning yourself into a bucket of tears.
(furiously) Who'd have thought any man could be
possessed of such effrontery? Such a lump of
wickedness ought to be transported at the public
charge to a desert island.

Ι’111 reduced to such a state that I don’t know in
the least how to deal with him.
