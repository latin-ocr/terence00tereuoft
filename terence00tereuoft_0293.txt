es. What torture this is ⁸ To be suddenly 001if1·ont‹·d
with such disaster Ξ What to do with myself, what
line to take, I can’t see. Apprehension brings
palsy on my limbs, fear has dazed my thoughts.
Confound it, how am I to clear myself from this
coil? To what a horrible suspicion Ι 3111 exposed!
And such a natural one! Sostrata thinks I have
bought this cithern-girl for myself : the old crone
let me into that. Ι happened to catch sight of
her on her way to the midwife’s, ran up and asked
her how Pamphila was, whether the birth was
imminent, whether that was the cause of her
errand. “Go away,'' eries 3116, “ go away3 you
have deceived us long enough, young Sir3 we
want no more of your broken promises.'' ‘⁶ What? ''
I said: “ for heaven's sake what do you mean by
that? '' ‘⁶ Good-bye,'' says she, “ stiek to the girl
of your choice.'' I saw in a flash the suspicion they
had, but Ι checked myself, for one word about my
brother to that chatterbox and all would be out.
What am I to do now? Say the girl is my
brother's? That secret must be kept at all

hazards. I won't breathe a word of it. Absolute
secrecy is still possible. Besides I doubt if they
would ever believe the truth. All the probabilities
are against it: it was Ι 11131 carried her off, Ι that
paid the money, it was to our house she was taken.
It was all my own fault, I own it. Badly as Ι may
have acted, why didn’t I tell my father all about it?
