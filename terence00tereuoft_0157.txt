THE MOTHER-lN-LAW

(crying) It’s not my doing, not my fault it happened,
1 swear it isn't.

Your fault and very much your fault. You were
sole mistress here, and to you clings the sole
blame, Sostrata. You should have taken care of
the house here, since of all other cares I relieved
the pair of you. Aren’t your grey hairs ashamed
of having come to feud with a girl? Will you say
it was her fault?
No indeed, I don’t say 30, my dear Laches.
I'm glad of that, by heaven yeS, for our son’s sake.
As for yOU‚ Ι am well assurcd, sin as you will you
can’t grow worse.
Are you quite sure, my dear husband, that her
dislike of me wasn't a mere pretence, only that she
might see more of her mother?
Don’t be absurd. Isn’t it proof enough that, when
you went to call on her yesterday, you were abso-
lutely refused admission?
No, no; they said that at the moment she was sadly
out of sorts: that's why I wasn’t admitted to see
her.
I expect her indisposition was more your humours
than anything else, and right enough t00. There
isn’t one of you women but wants her son to
marry: the match you set your fancy on is arranged:
your sons marry at your instigation, and at your
instigation they cast off their wives.

(speaking to his daughter within) Although Iknow,

· Philumena, that I have the right to compel you to

do my bidding‚ still my fatherly tendcrness is
strong enough to make me give way to you and

not oppose your desire. ⁷
