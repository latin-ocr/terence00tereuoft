580. (not seez'ng Chremes) What am Ι to do? Where can a
poor woman find a friend to take the case to or appeal
for help? I'm afraid my mistress will suffer a
shocking wrong from taking my advice. The young
man’s father, from what Ι hear, takes what we have
done like a fury.

Chr. (aside) Who is this old woman that's come in this
wild state from my brother’s?
