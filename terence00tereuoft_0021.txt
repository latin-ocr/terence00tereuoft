ACT I

ENTER Davus As FRoM THE P1AZZA, A punse ιΝ ’
ms HAND.

My great friend and countryman Geta came to me
yesterday. He had against me a trifling balance
on a piddling account. He asked me to make it
up, I have done 50, and here it is. I hear his
master’s son has taken a wife: it's for 1101, Ι sup-
pose, this money is soraping together. What an
unfair system it is that the poorer man always has
to give his mite to swell the richer man's 5101οἔ
What my friend 1135 struggled to save, farthing by
farthing‚ from his 13110115, robbing himself of his
pleasureS, she'll swallow down at a bite with never
a thought for the toil it eost him. Then again
Geta will be hit for another present when a child
is born and another on its birthday, and another at
the initiation ceremony. The mother will pocket
it all, the child will be the pretext for the gift.

ENTER Geta FRoM Demipho's noUsE.
(speaking to a servant within) If a red-headed fellow
asks for me
(intempting) All right: 11010 110 is.

(turning round) You've saved me going to look for
yon, Davus.

(handing him the purse) Here you are, take it, no
clipped 00111, 1110 511111 just what I owed.

Thank you, thank you; very good of you not to
overlook it.
