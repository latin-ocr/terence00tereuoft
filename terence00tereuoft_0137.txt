FI RsT PROLOGUE

This play is styled “ The Mother-in-laW.” On its
first presentation it was interrupted by a strange
and stormy scene, so that it could not be seen or
heard. In fact the people’s thoughts were blindly
preoccupied by a rope-dancer. On this occasion
clearly it is on the footing of a new play. The
author would not have it repeated at the time,
his wish being to have the profits of another per·
formance.. . . . You have heard others of his
plays ε now be so good as to hear this.
