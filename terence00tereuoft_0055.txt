Who's calling? (turning round and affecting astonish-
ment) Oh Sir!

Silence'

Behind your back, Sir, he has been throwing at you
all the time without a break insulting words that
don't fit you, Sir, and do fit kim.

No more. (turns to Phormio) Young Sir, in the first
place with your good leave Ι ask you, provided that
I may be so lucky that it please you, to answer me
one question. Expound to me who that personage
was whom you assert to have been your friend and
in what way he claimed relationship with me.
Fishing, just as if you didn't know him!

Know him?

YeS, know him.

I say I didn’t: as you say I did, recall him to my
memory. ’

Dear me nOW, not know your own cousin?

Grant me patience! Tell me his name.

His name?

Certainly. (a pause) Why don’t you answer?
(aside) Damn it! I've forgotten the name.

What do you say?

(turns and wilia-pers to Geta) Geta, if you remember
the name we gave at the time, prompt me. (cloud)
Pshaw! I don't tell you. As if you didn’t know
him, you come to me with your trickS.

Tricks? I?

After all what's it matter to me? Ι t’s Stilpho.
