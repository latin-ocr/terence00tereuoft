PHORMIO

the intention of the law that no Athenian gentle-
woman should be driven to shame by her poverty
and so it is enjoined that She be married to the
next of kin to live out her life with him? But you
are above the law,

[Demi. YeS, to the next of kin, but where do me come in?
Why be married to us?

V'lcor. Oh dear! “settled once, settled for ever,” as the
saying goes,

Ὁρτηί. Settled for ever? Ι will never rest till I have un-
settled it.

·‘⁹hor. Idle talk!

Demi. N ever you mind!

‘'’lz0r. As a last word, with you, Demipho, we have no
concern. The order of the court dealt with your
son, not with yon. In fact you had already passed
the age of matrimony. (boms to kim moe-Icingly)

l Demi. 'sake it that all Ι say now he says too: else, Ι assure
you, I shall forbid him my house and his wife too.

Geta (asido) A temper he's in!

A'Dlzor. Better forbid it to yourself.

Demi. Are you forearmed to thwart me at every point,

ou wretch?

⁰h0r. aside to Geta) He’s afraid of us though he tries hard
to hide it.

-3eta (aside to Phormio) You've done well so far.

Ι ΡΙιον. (to Demipho) Why can't you bear what you’ve got to
bear? It will be like your better aelf and so we
might be friends.

Ι Demi. (furiously) I want friendship with you? I choose to
see or hear you?

Phor. (mochingly) If you hit it off with her, you’ll have
somebody to be the charmer of your old age. Do
have thought for your grey hairs.
