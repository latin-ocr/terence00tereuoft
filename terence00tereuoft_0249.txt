THE BROTH ERS

ENTER Syrus FRoM Afficio’s nousE.
(to Aeschinus within) No more, Sir: 1’l·l see him in
person, I’ll soon make him eager to treat and say
he has been well treated besides. (comes sorn‘ard)
What's this I hear, Sannio, of your having a bit os
3 fight with my master?
The unfairest match that ever I saW, that between
us to-day. I taking, he giving, a drubbing, we’re
both fairly worn out.
It was your fault.
What ought I to have done?
Humoured him, being he's young.
How could Ι better, man? Why, Ι let him hit me
on the mouth.
Come now, do you know what I say about it?
Slighting money at the rignt moment is sometimes
the way to make it. Phew l you were afraid that
if you gave up an inch or two of your rights and
humoured our young gentleman, you silliest of al]
silly fellows, that it wouldn't come back to you
with interest.
Pay cash for expectations? Not Ι.
You’ll never make your fortune. Go along with
you, you don’t know the baits to catch men with,
Sannio,
(ironically) No doubt yours is the better way, but Ι
never had sharpness enough not to prefer all 1
could get on the nail.
Come, I know your spirit. Surei y a hundred pounds
is neither here nor there to you if you can oblige
our man. Besides, they tell me you're bound on 3

voyage to Cyprus.

Sannio (asido) The devil!
