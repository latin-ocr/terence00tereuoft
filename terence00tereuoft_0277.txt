THE BROTHERS

Heaven above us

One moment: you havcu't yet heard the worst.
Can there be anything worse to tell?

Indeed there is. So much must in some way be
put up with. There were the inducements 01
darkneSS, passion, wine, young blood: it’s human
nature. On realizing what he had done he came
of his own accord to the girl's mother, weeping,
begging, beseeching, promising, swearing to marry
her. He was forgiven, the matter was hushed up,
his word was taken. The girl is now with child,
it’s the tenth month. Our honest gentleman, bless
us all, has bought a cithern-player to live with:
the other he deserts.

Are you quite sure of your facts?

The girl's mother can be produced, there’s the girl
herself, there's the obvious fact, and here’s Geta
too, not a bad fellow as slaves go and active enough.
He finds them a livelihood, he's the sole prop of
the whole house. Take him off, put him in setterS,
have the truth out of him.

Ay, put me on the rack if it isn’t the truth, Sir
Put him to it and he won’t deny it. Have him up
before yon.

(aside) I'm ashamed. I don’t know what to do or
how to answer him.

(within) Oh the pain, the pain! Help, Madonna⁰
Save me for mercy’s sake.

What, is her time come ?

Certainly, Sir.

See nOW, there she is, appealing to the honour ot
your house, Demea. Let what you are forced to
do be done of your good will. I pray heaven that,
if possible, your course may be such as becomes
