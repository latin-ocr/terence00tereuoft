THE MO'l'HER-lN-LAW

How SO.

Ruined '
Why ?
(clutclec'ng Parmeno's arm) It’s something terrible
you’re hiding from me, Parmen03 I’m sure of it.
They said your wife had something of shivering
fits. Ι don‘t know how that may be.
Death! why didn‘t you tell me?
I couldn't tell you everything at once.
What's she ill of?
I don’t know.
What? Haven't they called in‘a doctor
I don’t know.
I must go in at once to learn the worst straight off.
(goes to the door and stops) In what condition shall
Ι find you now, my Philumena? If you are in danger,
my life is gone with yours, is gone with yours.

[Exrr 1N'ro THE Housss.
It’s no good my going in now after him. Ι know
we're all odious to them: yesterday they positively
refused to let in my mistress. If her illness chauces
to get worse (as Ι hope it won't, chiefly for my
young master's sake) they'll cry out at once that a
servant of Sostrata’s came into the house and swear
he brought in something dangerous to their lives
and so her illness was made worse. The mistress
will get hotly blamed and I hotly punished.

ENTER Sostrata.

(not seeing Parmeno) Oh dear, for some time I've
heard some disturbanoe going on over the way.
I am sadly afraid Philumena's illness is getting
worse. (lzflz'ng her hands) I pray all the powers of
health may avert it. Now I shall go and visit her.
