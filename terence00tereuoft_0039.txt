PH ORMIO

(much alarmed) I can't face him. (going)
No, n0, what are you about? ‚Where are you off to} ’
Stop, Ι say.
Ι know myself and my‘offence. I trust you two
with Phanium and my life.

[Exl'r. The two others look blankly at each other.
What now, Geta?
You'll get a wigging on the spot, Ι shall be sti-apped
up and drubbed, or else I’m much mistaken.
However the advice we gave just now to your
cousin, that’s what we ought to follow ourselveS, Sir.
“Ought'' be hanged! Just tell me what to do,
Do you remember the defence we talked over som
time back, when we projected the enterprise‚ so as
to get clear of blame, how the cause was right and
straight and sure to win, just perfect.
I remember.
Very well, that's the defence that's wanted now or
a better and cleverer one if we can find it.
I shall do my best.
You must begin the attack, Ι shall lie in ambush
here as a reserve force in case you give ground.

All right. (they stand aside)

An tipho has married a wife without my leave?
What, no regard for my authority—I won't mention
authority—for my indignation even? No shame
either? What atrocious assuranc⁶³¹ And Geta what
a pretty adviser!
