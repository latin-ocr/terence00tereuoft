So,

 

THE BROTHERS

No, n0, not for the world: Ι won’t.

What shall you do?

Disclose it.

Odi dear, my dear lady, are you sure what you are
a out?

Things can’t be in a worse position than they arc
nOW. In the first place she has no dowry: next
what's worse, that which was next best to a dowry is
lost) She can’t be married with an untarnished name.
There's only one way left: if he denies the fact, Ι
have a witness in the ring which he let drop. Lastly
as my conscience tells me that with this fault I have
no connexion and that there has been no payment
of money or anything else unfitting my daughter
or me, Geta, Ι will go to court. ,

Very well, Ma’ani, 1 give in, your suggestion is the
better.

Off with you quick as you can and give her kinsman
Hegio a full account of the facts, He was my poor
dear Simulus’s nearest friend and has always been

most attentive to us‚
(bitterly) Most indeed ¹ There’s no one else regards us

at all. [ssxrr.
Now, dear Canthara, make haste, run and call the

midwife that she may be at hand when she's

wanted.

ENTER Demea Mucu AGITATED.

Demea Death and destruction l I have learnt that Ctesipho

had 3 hand with Aeschinus in this affray. lt's the
crown of my miseries if the son who is still good
for something can be enticed by the other into

(lebauchery. Where am Ι to look for the boy?
