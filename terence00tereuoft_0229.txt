PROLOGUE

Our playwright‚ having become aware that his
composition is unfairly criticized and that his
enemies carp at the play which we are about to
present, will give evidence in his own case and you
shall be the court to decide whether the line he has
taken ought to redound to his honour or to his
discredit. “Linked in Death’' is a comedy by
Diphilus. Plautus turned it into Latin without
change of title. In the Greek play there is a
young man who in the first act carries offa girl from
a slave-dealer. Plautus omitted this incident.
Our playwright has introduced it, translated word
for word, into his “Brothers.'' This is the new
play which we are about to present. It is for you to
scrutinize whether in your view this is a theft or
the recovery of an incident which was negligently
’ omitted.

As for the malignant accusation that our play-
wright is assisted by men of high rank who perpetu-
ally aid him with the pen, his enemies may regard
it as a bitter reproach, but he himself considers it as
a high honour that he finds favour with those who
are in favour with all of you and with the country
at large, men of whose assistance in war and in the
various occupations of peace every one has at his
need availed himself and thought no shame.

I will not detain you on the plot of the play.
Part of it will be opened by the old men who first
come on the stage, the rest will appear in the course
of the action. See that your candour stimulates

the poet’s zeal in his calling.
