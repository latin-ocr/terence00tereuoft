THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

more I was aboard ship and all the time Ι was
looking forward to death, poor devil 3 the weather

’ was that bad all the voyage through.

Sickening!

I know it was sickening. In fact, by Jove, I should
run away rather than go back home if I were told
I must go back there.

(Sneering) Before now small causes have prompted
you to do what you now threaten to do, Sosia. Ah,
there’s Pamphilus himself standing at the door:
go you indoors, I’ll step across and see if he wants
me for anything. [EXEUNT Sosia ΛΝΒ, SERVANTS.
Still standing here, Sir?

Yes, I've been waiting for yOU.

What for, Sir?

I want to send a message at once to the Citadel.
(sulkily) Who’s to go?

You,

To the Citadel? Why there?

Find out Callidemides with whom I stayed at My-
conus and who came over in the ship with me.
(aside) Damn! You might think he'd vowed if he got
home safe to make me broken-winded by his
errandS.

Why don't you start?

What do you want me to tell him? Am I to find
him out and nothing more?

No, I had an appointment with him to-day3 tell him
I can't come, to save his waiting for me in vain.
Away on wingS.

But I don’t know the gentleman by sight.

I'll describe him so that you can't miss him: a tall,
ruddy, curly-headed, burly, blear-eyed fellow with
a face like a corpse.
