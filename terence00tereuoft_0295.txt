THE BROTHERS

Ι could have won him over to let me marry her.
I have been dilatory all this time: from this
moment, AeschinUS‚ wake up! The first thing to
do is to go to the women and clear myself. There’s
the door. (moves towards it, then stops) Confusion ἱ
I'm always of a shudder when I start knocking at
this door, poor wretch. (mocks) Anyone there?
It's Aeschinus. Open the door some one at once.
(the door opens) Some one coming out? I'll stand
aside. (goes behind the door)
ENTER Micio THROUGH THE DoonwAv.

Micio (at tlze door) Do as Ι have told you, Sostrata, both

of you, I will see Aeschinus to let him know

of these arrangements. (turns round) Some one
knocked : who was it?

Aes, (aside) Heavens! it's my father. Destruction!
Micio Aeschinus !
Aes. (aside in confusion) What's the meaning of this?

Micio Was it you knocked here? (as-ide) No answer?
Why shouldn’t Ι play with him a bit? He deserves
it for never choosing to tell me himself. (αἶα-πά)
Have you no answer for me ?

Aes, N-n-not there, Sir, as far as I know

Micio So? I wondered what business you could have
there. (aside) He blushed: all's well.

A eS. Tell me, father, please what takes you there?

Micio No business of my own: a friend of mine brought
me here just now to help him in a law affair.

Aes, What affair ?

Micio I will tell you. There are some ladies living here
in a very small way. I think you don't know
them, in fact I’m sure you don't: it isn’t long since
they moved here.

A es, What follows ? 285
