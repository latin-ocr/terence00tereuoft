PHORMIO

For heaven’s sake tell me how things stand with

me. Any luck? Has my father any scent of the

truth?

Not the least.

Any hope, eh?

Can’t say.

Ah!

Only Phaedria hasn’t slackened in his efforts for you.

No novelty that.

And Phormio too in this matter, as always, has been·

all energy.

What did he do?

Your father was boiling over with fun-v and he

quelled him.

Eram, Phormio!

(with much modesty) I myself too did what I could.

My dear Geta, I love you all.

The first engagement was as Ι tell you. Up to now

there is a lull in the operations and your father

means to wait for your uncle to come.

Why for my uncle?

He said he meant to follow his advice as far as this

affair goes,

How alarming the prospect of my uncle’s safe

return, Geta, for on his single vote by your account

hangs my life or death.

Here comes Phaedria, Sir.

Where?

There, coming out of his playground. (suiggers)
ENTER Phaedria FROM Dorz'o’s wrru Dorio.
