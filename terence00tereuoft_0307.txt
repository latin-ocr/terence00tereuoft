Demea As Ι hope to be saved, Ι see your tomfoolery.
Ι believe your object is to sing to her accompani-

NIicz‘o Enough, Demea, enough ; drop your ill temper,
think of the occasion, be merry and sociable at
your son⁷s wedding. I’m going to call there.

Demea Heaven above ας. What a life! What morals!

What lunacy ! The bride won't bring a halfpenffgff
