THE BROTHERS

. ACT IV
<Half an lzour has elapsed.)

ENTER Ctesipho ΛΝΒ Syr-us FnoM Msz‘cio’s nomin.
Do you really mean that my father is gone ost to
the country ?

Some time ago,

No, but really?

He's at your country house. (grinning) Ι expect at
this very moment he’s on some farm job.

I hope to heaven he is ! Short of hurting his
health Ι should like him to get so tired out that
for the next three days he couldn’t get out of bed.
That Ι desire, or, if possible, something better.
Just SO, for I’m dreadfully eager to pass the whole
day as I have begun it in unbroken delight. And
the chief spite I have against our country place is
that it's so near. If it were further off, night would
have overtaken him before he could get back here
a second time. As it is, not finding me there,
he'll trot back here in a moment,I am sure of
that. There'll be a volley of questions where I've
been: “ I haven’t had a sight of you all day.”
What's to be my answer?

Nothing occur to you?

(blankly) Nothing at all.

The more good for nothing you! Is there no
dependant, acquaintance, family friend?

There are: what follows?

So that you had business with ’em?

When I hadn’t? Not to be said!

To be said.

(dubiously) For the daytime, but if I stop the night

here, what excuse can I make, Syrus?
