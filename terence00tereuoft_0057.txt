l Phor,

PHORMIO

I neither knew him nor ever had a kinsman of that

name.

You say that? No shame in presence of your friends?

Ah, if he had left an estate of some thousands—-

Heaven blast you!

—you would have been the first to produce an exact

pedigree tracing from your grandfather and your

grandfather’s grandfather and all that.

(trying to keep his temper) True. If I had been at

the trial I should have stated how she was related

to me: do you the same. State how she’s related

to me.

Bravo! Well said our side! (aside to Phormio) I say.

be cautious,

I gave a clear account where I was bound to give

it, in court. If it was a fiction then, why didn't

your son then upset it?

Talk to me of my son? I can't find words to express

his folly.

Well, as you at least are no fool, go before the court

and ask them to grant you a new trial of the case,

since you are sole monarch here and the sole man

who may have the same case tried twice.

Victimized as I am, still, rather than be perpetually

at law or have to listen to yon, I will assume she is

related to US, and, as the statute prescribes the

amount of the dowry, take you her away and accept

the five a-nd twenty poundS.

Ha, ha, ha! a pleasant gentleman!

What do you mean? Isn't it a fair proposal? Am I

not even to have common justice?

And pray do you really mean to tell me that when

you have treated her as a courtesan the law says

you are to pay her and whistle her off? Wasn't it
