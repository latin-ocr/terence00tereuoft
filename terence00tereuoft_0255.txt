THE BROTHERS

ENTER Aeschinus.
Where’s that piece of impiety?
(staning formard) It's me he means. Anything in
his hand? Damn! Ι can’t see anything.

(to Ctesipho) Ah, well met: I was looking for you.
How goes it Ctesipho? All’s secure: no more of
your glum looks!

No more indeed, by Jove n0, with a brother like
you. My dear Aeschinus, my true brother! Oh,
Ι dare not praise you more to your face ; you might
take it for flattery else instead of gratitude.

Silly boy! Surely at this time we know one
another, Ctesipho. What pains me is that on this
side the discovery was so late and things were almost
come to the pass where the best will of the whole
world couldn’t have helped you.

(bashfully) I was too modest.

Folly, dear boy, not modesty. A trifle like that

almost make you flee the country? Scandalous!
God forbid such a thing l

I was wrong.
(to Syrus) Pray‚ what says our friend Sannio·
He’s tamed down.
I'm going to the Piazza to pay him. In with you,
Ctesipho, to your love.
[Exrr Ctesipho 1NTo THE uousss.

(aside to Syrus) Press it, Syrus
(airily) Let's be off: our friend‘s for Cyprus and in
haste. (tea-sing lzim)

(angrily) Not so much as you want. I've plenty of
time and here Ι stop.

You shall be paid, never fear. 245
