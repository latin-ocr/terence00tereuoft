THE BROTHERS ’

Ηο 1135 spent all his days without a calling, given
up to society, complaisant, easy—going, astronting
no man and having a smile for everybody. He has
lived for himself and spent his money on himself,
all the world speaks well of him and loves him. Ι

·’ 1110 rugged countryman, sour and thrifty, hot-headed

and close-fisted, took a wife. What a world of
misery that brought me ! Sons were born to me :
another anxiety Ξ Heigho l struggling to make all
the money Ι 0011Ιά 101· 1110111 Ι 113νο worn out the
prime 01 my 1110 111 getting it. Now in this last act
of life's drama the reward that my 1011 for them
receives is—dislike! That brother of mine with
no effort enjoys all a father's comfortS. They love
him, they skulk from me. To him they confide all
their designS, on him they bestow their affection, in
his house the pair ofthem spend their time, and I 3111
1011 (10501310. They pray for his life, with me it's
death they are waiting for, not a doubt 01 11. To me
it has been an endless 1011 10 bring them up, and
he has made them his at an insignificant eost. Ι
endure all the misery, he enjoys all the delight.
Come then, come, let us now adventure the opposite
course and see whether I have any power 01 win-
ning speech and kind act, since he challenges me
to it. Like him Ι desire to be loved and valued by
my own kin. If the means to that end be liberality
and complaisance, I will play none but the leading
part. The money will fail, but that matters least
to me who am the oldest of the four.
ENTER Syrus.
Please, Sir, your brother begs you not to go and
