THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

(coming formard) Please, Ma’am.

(lumi—ng round to him> VVho's there?

You’ll be refused admittance a second time.

Ah ParmenO, are you there? Oh dear‚ it’s dreadful,
what can Ι do? Am I not to visit Pamphilus’s wife
when she’s lying ill over the way?

Visit her, Ma’am? You mustn't even send anyone to
inquire. To love one who dislikes you is double
folly, I think: you lose your labour and you annoy
the other person. Besides your son went in, the
moment he arrived, to see how she is.

What, is Pamphilus come back?

YeS, Ma’am.

(lzfling her hands) Thank heaven! Oh, your words
put heart in me again and all my anxiety is de-
parted.

Now that's my chief reason for wanting you not to
go in, for, if the lady’s pains get at all easier, she’ll
tell him all, I’m sure, the moment they two are
alone together, all the trouble between you and
what her resentment started from. Here he is,
coming out. How sorrowful he looks!

ENTER Pamphihta
(thromz'ng herself into his arms) My dearest boy!

. Mother mine, I hope you're well.

Ι am so glad you are come back well. Is Philu-
mena well?

. (in much disorder) A little better.

 

Heaven grant it! Why are you in tears then? Why
so sorrowful?

Ι 'm all right, mother.

What was the bustle about? Tell me. A sudden

attack of pain? ι 59
