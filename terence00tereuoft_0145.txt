formard) lsn't that little Philotis? 'where is she
come from? Philotis, a very good day to you·
Good day, Parmeno,

Glad to see yon, Parmeno,

And very glad to see you, Syra. Well, Philotis,
where have you been enjoying yourself all this
time ?

Mighty little enjoyment I've had, going away to
Corinth with a regular brute of a captain. Two
years I've had of it there with him, unbroken
misery.

Jove, yes, I expect, Philotium, you’ve often been
seized with a longing for Athens and cursed yourself
for going away.

Words won’t express my eagerness to return, to get
away from the Captain and see you all again and
keep up my old life of free and easy revelry among
yon. At Corinth I wasn’t allowed it except with
instructions beforehand to say nothing but what
might please him.

A very inconvenient limit, I think, your Captain set
to conversation.

But what's this business Bacchis told me about just
now indoors? Never did I believe your master could
bring himself to marry in her lifetime.

Marry, you say?

Eh, what do you mean? Isn't he married?
Married, yeS, but I'm not so sure the marriage isn’t
a shaky business·

Heaven grant it be, if that will help Bacchis. But
tell me, Parmen0, on what grounds I am to think
so‚

It’s not a thing tolet out: don’t ask me any more.

For sear it should become public property, Ι suppose?
