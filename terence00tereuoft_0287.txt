THE BROTHERS

Demea What for?

Syrus He says it was Ι prompted buying the girl.

Demea Didn’t you say just now that you'd gone with him
into the country?

*Syrus So Ι did, but he came back here raving. He had
no mercy. Fancy not being ashamed to drub an
old fellow, and when he was an urchin no bigger
than that (illustratae) I carried him in my arms,

ζ Demea BraVO, Ctesipho! Good, good! A man, I warrant
you Σ

'Syrus Bravo indeed! My word, in future, if he’s wise,
he'll keep his fists to himself.

Demea Bravely done!

Syrus Oh very! Because he got the best of a poor lady
and a bit of a slave who daren't hit him back, pheW,
mighty bravely Ξ

Demea It couldn’t have been better. He sees as I do that
you are at the bottom of this business. But is my
brother at home ?

Syrus (sullcz'ly) No, he ain't.

Demea l wonder where Ι can find him.

Syrus Ι know where he is, (kalf aside) but hang me if I
ever tell you.

Demea What's that you say?

Syrus What I say.

Demea I’ll break your head on the spot.

Syrus (still affecting tlte sula-s) Well, I don't know the man's
name, but I know the place where he is.

Demea Tell me the place then.

Syrus Do you know the colonnade by the meat-market,
down that way? (points)

Demea Of course I do,

Syrus Go that way straight up the street. When you
get there the Slope is right down in front of you :
