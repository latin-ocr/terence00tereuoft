PHORMIO

Phor. This is a pretty high-handcd way of tris-ling with me.

Demi. How so?

I'Plzor. What a question! Why, I shan’t beeable to marry
the other girl either. How can Ι have the face to
go back to her after jilting her?

Chr. (mkisperz'ng to Demipho) Say “Resides I see Antipho is
unwilling to part with her.''

[Demi. Besides I see that my son is distinctly unwilling to
part with the lady. Now be so good as to come
across to the Piazza and tell the banker to retransfer
the money to my account.

Phor. What? The money on which I at once drew cheques
in favour of my creditors?

[Demi. (puzzled) What’s to be done then?

IPltor. (with an affectation ofdignz'ty) If you choose to give me
the bride whom you betrothed to me, Ι will marry
her, but if it is the case that you choose she shall
still stop with you, the dowry must stop here,
Demipho. (points to himself) Yes, it isn't right that
I should be taken in to help you gentlemen, when
out of respect for you I have broken with another
girl who was to bring just as large a dowry.

tDemaf. (angrily) Devil take you and your sublime airS, you
vagabond! Do you still think we don't know you
and your doings too?

lPlzor. You are provoking me.

''Demzl Would you marry her if she were offered you.

thor. Try me.

ssDemi. For my son to live with her in your house! 'l'hat’s
what you had schemed with him!

ΙΡΙιον. Pray, what are you talking about?

[Demi. Just give me back my money.

ΙΡΙιον. No, just you give me my wife.

γΙῑὶεηιί. (seizing kim) Come into court.
