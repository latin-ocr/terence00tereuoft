(testily) Why, he won’t marry her.

(sar-castically) Oh n0‚ of course not; and, when they

ask for the money back, doubtless for our sake he’ll
choose to go to jail. ’

There's nothing, Sir, that can’t be made worse by
the telling. What you do is cut out the good and
mention the bad. Now hear the other side. If he
takes the money for good, he must marry the wife,
as you say3 I grant that. After all, though, some
little time will be allowed to prepare for the wed-
ding, send out the invitationS, arrange the religious
part. Meantime his friends will supply what
they’ve promised: he'll pay it back out of that.

On what ground? What reason will he give?

That’s easy enough. He can say “The number of
ominous warnings I've had since the engagement!
A strange black dog came into my house, a snake
dropped off the tiles into the cistern, a hen crowed‚
a wizard vetoed‚ a diviner forbad it, I couldn’t think
of undertaking a new business before the shortest
day ''--—and that's the soundest excuse of all.
That’s what’ll happen.

If only it would!

It will: trust me. Your father’s coming out: off
with you, tell Phaedria the money’s there.

Be easy, 1 say: I'll take care he don't cheat us. l
shan't be so rash as to part with the money except
before witnesseS. I shall recite to whom I’m giving
it and what I’m giving it for.
(aside) Mighty cautious when there's no need!
YeS, that’s the way you must do it, and make haste
