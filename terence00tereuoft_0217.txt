THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

girl from whom, he said, in a struggle he had pulled
off this ring. Myrrina recognized it just now on
my finger. She asked me where Ι got it and I told
her the whole story. This led to a recognition:
Philumena was the girl and the child is her husband’S.
I am glad to have been the occasion of all this happi-
ness befalling them. It is not what others of my class
would like, for it is not to our interest to have mar-
riages happy. For my part I vow I will never lei
mercenary motives induce me to play a wicked part.
So long as Ι fairly might Ι found him liberal, charming,
and good-humoured. The marriage was inconvenient
for me, Ι admit, but Ι think I have so acted as not
to deserve the inconvenience. When a thing brings
many advantages it is only fair to put up with the
disadvantages which it involves. (goes aside)

ENTER Pamphilus AND Parmeno,
Be sure nOW, my good ParmenO, be quite sure that
your news is certain and definite, else you may allure
me into a delight that is but momentary and
groundless.
Sure I am.
Absolutely?
Absolute] y.
I am in heaven if this is se.
You'll find it true.
Stop now, stop, please: Ι am afraid that Ι may be
believing one thing and you reporting another.
Well.
What I understand you to have said is that Myrrina
has discovered that Bacchis has her ring.
That is so,
ΤΙιε ring Ι gave her some time ag0‚ and she told

you to report this to me: is that so?
