THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

Scene s——Atlzemz A street, on one side the house of
LacheS, on the otlzer that of Phidippus,

ACT I
ENTER Philotis AND Syra.
On my word, Syra, i'c’s very few men that you
would find to be faithful lovers to women of my
class, For instance Pamphilus here, how often

he swore to Bacchis, so solemnly that anyone might
readily have believed him, 'chat he would never take
a wife in her lifetime! *Now see, he has taken one.
And on that account I earnestly urge and conjure
you to have no pity on any man. Plunder, worry,
harry every man you come across
And make no exception?
Not one. There is not one of ’em, you may be sure,
comes to you except with the intention of coaxing
you into sating his love of pleasure as cheaply as
ever he can. And then, my good girl, aren't you
to lay your snares for them?
Still Ι vow it's wrong to treat all alike.
Wrong to avenge oneself upon one’s enemies?
VVrong for them 'co be caught as they’d catch you?
Oh dear, dear, why havcn't either Ι your youth and
beauty or you my sentiments?

ENTER Parmeno FaoM Laches’ Housa.
(at the door, speaking to a servant within) If our old
man asks for me, tell him I've just stepped down
to the harbour ’co inquire about Pamphilus's arrival.
Do you hear what I say, Scirtus? Ι say, if he asks.
for me, you are to tell him that3 if he doesn’t ask,
never you tell him. Ι don't want to spoil an excuse

that would do another time. (turns round and comes
