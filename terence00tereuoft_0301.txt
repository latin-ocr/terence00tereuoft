THE BROTHERS

far as it' lay with you. What, did you think heaven
would do your work while you slept, that without
your lifting a finger the wife would be brought
home to the bridal ehamber? I should be sorry
to see you so thoughtless in the rest of your affairs.
(a pause) Be of good heart ε you shall marry her.

AeS. What, Sir!

Micio Be of good beart, Ι say.

Aes. Father, in honour's name, you‘re not mocking me,
are you ?

„Micio No indeed: why should I ?

Aes. I don’t know3 l'm so desperately eager for this to
be true, and that makes me fear the more.

Micio Go off home, pray for heaven's favour in fetching
your wife. Off with you.

Aes, What? My wife at once?

Micio At once.

AeS. At once ?

Micio As soon as ever you can.

Aes. All the anger of heaven on my head, father, if l

„don’t love you more than my own eyes !

Micio What ? More than— eh ? (smiles and points to Pam-
phila’s house)

Aes, Just the same.

Micio Very kind of you.

AeS. (starting) But by the way, where’s that Milesian ?

Micio Lost, vanished, gone aboard ship. Why are you
lingering ?

Aes. You g0, father: you are more likely to gain heaven‘s
favour. I am sure you are a much better man
than I am and they will have more ear for your
prayers.

Micio I am going indoors to make the necessary prepara-

tions. Do as I tell you if you are wise.
