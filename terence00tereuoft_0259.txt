THE BROTHERS

Bless yon, he'll be here in a minute: he never
misses a day, he always comes,
He’s my only stay in my troubles.
Considering the circumstances things are as well as
they could be, Ma'am. It's well the lover was a man
like that, such a character and such a good heart,
and os such a high family toz).
Indeed he is what you call him: Heaven preserve
him to us 3

(pac-ing up and domn aad not seeing ίΙιε others) Now it’s
come to this that if all the world put all their heads
together to find a way out of this trouble, they
couldn't help us the least bit, trouble to me and
my mistress and my mistress’s daughter. Lord
deliver us! a bristling wall of evils and not a way
over it! Violence‚ poverty, wickedneSS‚ 110191033-
11033, disgrace! What a world! Oh the sins of it,
the tribes of impiety, the unnatural wretch !
(aside to Canthara) Mercy on us, why is Geta 30
terrified and so agitated?
(as before) His honour, his oath, compassion, not one
of them kept him or turned him back, not even the
throeS, 30 near at hand, of the poor lady whom he
had 30 shamefully and violently outraged.
(as before) I can’t quite follow what he says.
Let us go nearer, Ma'am, pray. (they come more
formard) ’
(as before) Heavens l I'm almost off my head, I’m

such a blaze of passion. There’s nothing 1 should like
better than to have that whole household put in

front of me so as to disgorge all my fury on them
