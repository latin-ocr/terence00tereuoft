THE BROTHERS

nexion of ours, not a rich man: we‘ ought to do
something for him.

Do what?

You have something of a small farm a little way

out of town which you are by way of letting: let

us give it to him for an income.

Small do you call it?

[f it’s a big one, still it must be done. He has

been a father to her, he's a worthy person, he's

one of ourselves3 it's right to give it. In fact I

adopt as mine the sound and wise saying which

you uttered some time ago ε “ It’s a flaw common to

us all that in old age we think too much of money.''

That is a stain we ought to avoid. The saying

was sound and should be carried out in action.·

Do, father.

Very well : Hegio shall have the farm as the boy

desires it.

How glad I am

Now you’re my real brother, soul as well as body.

(aside chuclcling) I cut his throat with his own sword.
ENTER Syrus.

(to Demea) Your instructions have been carried out,

Sir.

That’s an honest fellow. (to Micio) Well then on

my word here’s one juryman at any rate says it's

right Syrus should be made a free man.

That fellow made a free man? Why?

For many reasons.

(to Demea) O Sir, you are a good man, Sir, I vow

you are. I have looked after both the young

gentlemen since their boyhood, zealously 1 have

1’ve taught ’em, counselled ’em, always given ’em

good instructions as far as my power went. 319
