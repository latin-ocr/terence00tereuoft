THE BROTHERS

RE—ENTER Syrus T1Psv.
S’help me, little SyruS, you've taken downy care oi
yourself and filled your office in fine style. G'along.
Stin, as I've filled my belly indoors from all the
dishes, taking a stroll out here has caught my fancy.
Look at that, so please you : a pattern of domestic
discipline!
(seeing Demea) Hollo nOW, here's our old man.
(staggers up to lzz'm) What‘s going on? Why are
you s' glum?
You scoundrel!
That’ll do, So you're pouring out your maxims here,
old Wisdom?
If you were my man——
(interrupting) You'd be rich, you would, Master‚
and have put your fortunes on a firm footing. (harches)
—I should have made an example of you to the
whole household.
What for? What have I done?
Done? In the very middle of this trouble, with a
great wrong committed and hardly settled yet,
you've been drinking, you scoundrel, as if you were
celebrating a great achievement.

(aside) Sorry I came out, that Ι am.
