THE BROTHERS

while the smart is fresh. First I’il orush the
breath out of the old man, the master, him that
brought the monster up. Then as for Syrus who

him by the waist‚ lift him up, and dash his skull
right on the ground to scatter his hrains over the
pavement. For the young man I'd tear out his
eyes and then hurl him over a precipiee. The
rest of 'em I’d knoek down, worry to bits, trample
and crush under my feet. But why don’t Ι hurry

, 1116. Ma’am—(lzesitates)

Oh dear!

Why so excited, my deal· Geta? Get your brcath
back.

Utterly what, then ?

Undone : all’s over,

For heaven’s sake explain

Now—(hesitates)
“ Now ” what, Geta ?
