PHORMIO

to cut the tale short, my faithfulness to the old
man played the devil with my shoulderbladeS.
(sententiously) Just what occurred to me. YeS, yeS,

Phaedria at once carne across a slip of a girl, a
cithern-player, and fell desperately in love with
her. She belonged to 3 real beast of a slave-dealer
and there wasn't a penny to give ; the fathers had
seen to that. The only thing lest was to feed his

we helped Master Phaedria. The school she went
to had right opposite it a barber's shop: that’s
where we used generally for the most part to wait
for her to 601116 out and go home. One day, as

the funeral. It wrung my heart3 and the girl 3
real beauty too! ” In short his story touched us
all. Then at once, 61163 Antipho‚‘ ‘Shall we go
and visit her?'' Says another, I vote we do,
601116 along, show us the way, pleaseff' We start,
we' re there, we see her, 3 lovely girl and you
