THE BROTHERS

Aes. (alrily) If I were a monarch, you shoul‘d have a place
to suit your qualities.

Sannio What have you to do with me?

A es, Nothing.

Sannio Do you know what sort of man Ι am?

A ea. I have no yearning for that knowledge.

Sannio Have I laid a finger on anything of yours?

Aes, If you had, you'd have been suffering for it.

Sannio What greater right have you to detain my girl
whom Ι bought and paid for? Answer me that.

Aes. You will find it just as well not to bellow in front
of the house. Ay, if you persist in your annoyance‚
you shall be haled in straight away and be covered
with stripes till you're half dead.

Sannio Stripes to a free man?

Aes. You’ll find it s0.

Sannio Beast of a man! And this is Athens, where they
say all free men are equal! '

Aes. If you have brawled enough, master slave-dealer,
now be so good as to listen.

Sannio Who's the brawler? I or you?

A es, Drop that, come to business.

Sannio What business? What am I to come to?

A es. Are you ready yet for me to tell you what concerns

p
Sannzo ³{ga-dy? Eager3 it must be a fair proffer, though.
Aes. Bah· A slave-dealer and wants me to make no

unfair proffer.

Sannio Slave-dealer I am, the common bane, 1 own it, of
youth, liar, and nuisance; still J didn't start out-
raging yon.

Aes. (sarcastically) Pugh! that’s to come, is it?

Sannio Please go back to your starting point, Aeschinus.
