THE MOTHER-IN—LAW

any torture on them in your inquiry. Our present
business is this: Ι have to make Pamphilus’s wife
return to him: if I succeed Ι have nothing to regret
in the reputation of standing alone as having done
what other women of my class studiously avoid.

Laches Phidippus, we have discovered by actual proof that
we suspected our wives without a cause: let us now
go on to test Bacchis. If your wife finds out that
she had no cause for believing the accusation, she
will drop her resentment. If the cause of my son's
resentment is, as it is, the secrecy of the delivery,
‘that's a trifle3 his resentment on that account will
soon fall from him. Clearly there is no mischief in
the matter to justify a divorce.

Phi. I'm sure I hope s0.

Laches Make your examination3 here she is; she will give
you satisfaction.

Plzi. Why all this to me? Surely you heard from my
own lips what is my mind on the matter3 it is only

„Laches Now, Bacchis, Ι beg you to keep the promise you

natural enemieS.

Laches No, n0‚ they will be friendly enough when they
find out the object of your visit, for by freeing
them from their mistake you will free yourself from
suspicion.

Bacchis Oh dear, dear, I’m ashamed to appear before Phi-

lumena. Come you two with me.
