THE BROTHERS

ς Micio There's a girl and her mother.

ξ Aes, YeS, and?

Micio The girl has lost her father, my friend is next of
kin, and the law enjoins a marriage between them.

AeS. (asz'de but overheard) Destruetion!

Micio What’s the matter?

Aes. Nothing, nothing3 it’s all right: well ?

Micio He is come to take her with him : Miletus he lives at.

Aes, What! Take the girl with him?

Micio That is so.

AeS. O heavenS, all the way to Miletus?

Micio Yes,

AeS. (ct-Side) Oh my heart! (aloud) And the ladies?
what do they say?

Micio What do you expect them to say? Some nonsense.
The mother has faked up a story about a child by
some other man, but she doesn’t give him a name.
He 631116 first, she sayS, and her daughter oughtn't
to be married to my friend.

Aes. Good Lord Ξ and don't you think the claim is just ἔ

Micio No, Ι don't.

Aes, You don’t? Oh heavens! and is he to take her

ο away, father?

Micio Why shouldn’t he ?

¹ Aes. Your side 1135 acted harshly and barbarously and
what's more, if I must speak more openly, father,

κ 1101 like gentlemen.

3> Micio How so?

ξ AeS. Can you ask? Pray what do you ‘suppose will be

'³ the feelings of the unhappy man who loved her
first and for all Ι know is desperately in love with
her still, poor wretch‚ when he sees her snatched
off before his very eyeS, dragged out of his sight?

A monstrous aet, father'
