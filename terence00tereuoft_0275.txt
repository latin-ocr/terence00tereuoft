THE BROTHERS

on the remains of that breed still among ωε, ah
there's joy in life yet. I’ll stop to greet him and
talk with him.
ENTER Hegio AND Geta IN coNVERSA'rioN.
Hegio (not seez'ng Demea) Great heavens! a monstrous act,
Geta: can it be so?
Geta It's a fact, Sir.

⁷ Hegio That house the source of such an ungentlemanly

action! Aeschinus, Aeschinus, I swear you’ve not
trodden in your father's stepS.

Demea (aside) Obviously he has heard about this cithern-
girl. It's painful to him though he’s 3 stranger in
blood, the father doesn't care 3 jot. Dear, dear, I
wish he'd been by somewhere tc hear this.

Hegio If they don't take the righteous line, they shan‘t
carry it off like this.

Geta Oh Sir, 311 our hope rests on you, there’s no one
else, you are her champion, her father. My old
master entrusted us to you with his last breath : if
you forsake uS, we are undone.

Hegio Don’t name it ε Ι won't do it ε Ι should think myself
deaf to the call of affection.

Demea (aside) I will go up to him. (aloud, coming formard)
The best of health to you, H egiO.

Hegio (coldly) Ah, the very man Ι was looking for. Good
day to yOU, Demea.

Demea You were looking for me?

Hegio Yes. Your elder son Aeschinus, whom you gave
to your brother to adopt, has acted very unlike an
honest man and a gentleman.

- Demea How is that?
Hegio You knew our friend and contemporary Simulus?

Demea Of course Ι did.

Hegio His daughter has been wronged by your son. 26
