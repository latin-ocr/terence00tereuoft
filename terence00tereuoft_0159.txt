shall find out all about it. (Phidippus comes formard)
Phidippus, Ι 3111 aware of my remarkable indulgence

to all my family, still my good-nature doesn’t run
to the extreme of corrupting their hearts. If you

acted like me, it would be better for both our families.

As it is, Ι see that you are under the control of your
womankind.

(scomeficlly) Oh, really now?

1 called on you yesterday about your daughter: you
let me go away no clearer than I came. It’s not
the thing to do, if you wish for a lasting alliance
between us, to leave your resentment unexplained.
If there has been any fault on our side, name it.
Either by refutation or by apology we shall make
such amends as you will own may satisfy you. 11
your reason for detaining your daughter is that she
is ill, Ι consider that you do me a wrong if you fear

that she will lack any attention in my house. As
Ι hope to be saved, Ι don't concede to you, her
father though you are, that you are more interested
in her welfare than Ι 3111. My interest is for my
son’s sake, who, Ι have seen well enough, esteems
her no less than his own self. And I don't conceal
from myself how deeply he will be affected if he
comes to know it. Τ hat is why I am cager for her
to return home before he gets back.

Laches, Ι 3111 acquainted with your care and your
kindness, and I am ready to believe that what you
say is as you say, and I hope you will believe me in
turn when Ι tell you that Ι 3111 eager she should
return, if 1 can in any way bring it about.
