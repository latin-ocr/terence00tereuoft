the time to present the play, and you the means to
lend the befitting grace to these entertainmentS.
Do not allow any doing of yours to let dramatic art
fall into the hands of the few, but see that your
authority supports and assists mine. If I have
never been greedy enough to fix a price for my art
and have set myself to see the greatest profit in
serving your interestSâ€š grant that the playwright,
who has entrusted his calling to my protection and
to your honour, be not outwitted and mocked by
the unfair methods of an unfair clique. For my
sake listen to my plea and make a silent audience
that other playwrights may catch the desire to
write, and that it may be well for me in the future
to present new plays bought at my expense.
