SUMMARY oF THE PLAY

BV GAIUS SULPICIUS APOLLINARIS

Pamphilus has married Philumena, whom he had
before wronged without knowing who she was. A
ring, which he had taken from her by force, he
presented to BacchiS, a courtesan. He then de-
parted to Imbros without having lived with his wife.
When her mother found that as the result of the
outrage she was with child, under the pretence of
illness she took her back to her own house.
Pamphilus returning discovered the fact but kept
it secret, refusing however to receive her as his
wife. His father accused him of an intrigue with
Bacchis. Bacchis defended herself against the
charge, and this led to thei-ing being recognized
by Myrrina, the mother of the outraged girl.
Thereupon Pamphilus received his wife with their
son.
