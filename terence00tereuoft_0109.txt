for or not? Τ110 man it is. (retuming) You meei
me on the hop.

What is it?
O Sir, of all men living the most splendid in fortune 3
Past disputing you are the only favourite of heaven.

I wish Ι were! I should like you to tell me the
grounds for my thinking sc.

Shall you be satisfied if I dip you over head and
ears in delight?

Grant me patience!

Confound your promises! Tell your news

Oh, you're there too, PhormiO.

I'm here. Why do you trifle?

Listen: here goes. After we gave you the money

just now in the Piazza, we started straight back

home. Presently master sends me to your wife.
What for?
I omit that information, because it-'s not to the
point, Sir. I was just going into the ladies’ apart-
ments, when the boy Mida runs up, catches me by
the cloak, pulls me back. Ι look at him and ask
him why he’ s stopping me. He says the 01 ders are
‘no admission to the mistress' room.’ “My lady,’'
says he, “has just brought in master' s brother
Chremes and he' s in there with em now. '' When
he told me this, I started for the door on tip-toe
very quietly, got there, stood close, held my breath,
put my ear to the paneis So I listened hard,
trying, that way, to catch what they said.

thor. BraVO, Geta!

So then I heard something quite splendid, and
by Jove I nearly started for joy.
