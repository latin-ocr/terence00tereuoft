THE MOTHER-IN-LAW

ParmenO, is prescribed me by filial duty: on the
other hand Ι owe much to my wife, who in the
first days had‘the patience to bear with me, and
never at any time breathed a word of all my
affronts. Whatever you say it must have been

something very serious to occasion a quarrel which
has lasted all this time.

Or else, Sir, something trivial. If you choose to
make a right calculation, -it’s not' the greatest
wrongs that give rise to the greatest resentments.
No, Sir, it's often the case that, where another man
wouldn't even be irritated, your passionate man on
the same grounds becomes your bitter enemy.
Look at the trifling offences which set children
fiercely by the earS. Why so ? To be sure, because
the mind which guides them is a thing of weakness.
Those womenfolk are just the same as children, no
weight in their judgement. I shouldn't wonder if
it were a single word that stirred up all this
enmity.

In with you, ParmenO, and report my arrival. (a
ποίεε is heard from Phidippus's house)

Hollo, what's up?

Hush! I hear a bustle and a running to and‘frO.

Come, I’m going nearer the door. (does 80, ποίεε
again)
There, did you hear?
Don't·tell stories. (shriek within) God! I heard a
shriek.
You talk yourself and won’t let me.
(within) Hush, my child, pray, now ¹
lt was like her mother’s voice. I am lost
