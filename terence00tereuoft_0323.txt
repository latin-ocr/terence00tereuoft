THE BROTHERS

ENTER Aeschinus.
Aes, (not seez'ng the others) They bore me to death with
their anxiety over all the ceremonies of the wedding.
They’re wasting the whole day over the arrange-

ments,
Demea What's in hand, Aeschinus?
Aes. Ah, father dear, are you there?

Demea Yes indeed your father in heart no less than by
nature, who loves you more than 1113 own eyes,
But why don’t you fetch your wife across?

. Aes. I’m keen on it, but there's a hitch. They're waiting for
the musician and the choir for the marriage hymn.

Demea I say, my boy, will you listen to an old man?

Aee. What is it, Sir?

Demea Drop all this, the hymn, the to-d0‚ the lanterns,
the musicians, and have a 11016 knocked in the
garden-wall this very moment. Bring her in that
way, make one house of the two, bring mother and
household and all into ours.

Aes. Agreed, you old dear of a father!

Demea (aside) Bravo! I'm called an old dear now, My
brother's house will be turned into a thoroughfarc‘,
he'll have no end of people in, and it’ll eost him
heaven knows what. What does it matter to me?
I’m an old dear and step into favour. Now that
Don Magnifico may pay down 1113 hundred at a time.
(aloud) Syrus, why don't you go and do it?

Syrus Do what, Sir?

Demea Knock a 11016 in the wall. (to Aeschinus) You go
round and bring 'em through. [Exrr Syrus.

Geta Heaven bless you, Sir! I see you're a hearty
well-wisher to our family.

Demea Ι think they deserve it. (to Aeschinus) What do

you say to it? [extr (ι’ἔιιαδ.
