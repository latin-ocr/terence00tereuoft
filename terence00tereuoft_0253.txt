THE BROTHERS

N 0, no, hang it! please, SyruS, please. N ever
mind how I've been treated, rather than go to law
let me have my own repaid me, cost price anyhOW,
Syrus. (mheedlz'ng) Ι know you've had no tokens of
my friendship up to now: (giving him moneys) you
shall have cause to say that I don't forget and am
grateful.

I'll put my back into it. Ah, here comes Ctesipho :
he’s in joy about his mistress

But about my request?

One moment.

ENTER Ctesipho 1N RAPTURES.
(not seez‘ng the others) To geta good thing from anyone,
when you want it, may give you joy, but the only
real delight is when your benefactor is the right
man. O brother, brother mine, how can I find
words to praise you ? l This Ι am sure of, my most
splendid phrases must fall short of your goodness.
So there's one thing in which I think I take first
place of all ε there isn’t a man with a brother such
a complete master in every good quality.
(coming formard) Yon, Sir, is it?
Oh SyruS, where is Aeschinus?
At home there, waiting for you.
(ecstatically) Oh heaven*
What do you mean?
Don’t you know? O Syrus, it's his doing that I‘m
now alive. A pearl of a man 1 Why he sacrificed
all his interests to mine ζ the hard words, the dis-
repute, my trouble and offence, he took 'em all on
himself. It’s beyond anything. Why’s the door

011 the move? (turns to go)
Stop, stop, it’s your brother himself.
