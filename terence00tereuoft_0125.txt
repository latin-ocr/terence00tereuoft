PHORMIO

Oh heavens! what miserable baseness
(to Chremes) To be done? Doing's over.

Was ever any more monstrous wickedness? And

when it’s their wives, their youth is past! (turns
her back on Chremes) DemiphO, I appeal to you: to
this man of mine Ι haven't patience to speak.
'lhis is the meaning (is it ?) of those frequent
voyages, those lengthened visits, to Lemnos! These
are the low prices that brought down our rents!

Ι don’t deny, Nausistrata, that he has been to
blame in this matter, but surely it is an offence
that should be forgiven.

Phor. A funeral oration!

Nau.

Phor.

He didn't do it out of disregard, much less dislike,
for you. Some fifteen years ago in his cups he
met the woman who bore this child and has had
no commerce with her since. She is dead and
gone, and thus the difficulty in the matter is
removed. So Ι beg you to show your usual good-
humour and put up with it.
Why should I show good humour? Wretch that
Ι am, Ι wish this were the end, but how can Ι
hope so? Am Ι to think that years will make him
more innocent in the future? He was grey-headed
already, if it's grey hairs that make men restrain
themselves. Is the attraction of youth and beauty
greater in me now than then, Demipho! What
reason do you give why I should expect or even
hope that in the future he will be a changed man?
(loudly) Oyezl oyez! oyez! All whom it concerns
are desired this very hour to attend the funeral of
Chremes! That’s my style. Come now, anyone
want to challenge Phormio? Let him. I’ll make him
the victim of such disaster as Chremes has. (chang-
